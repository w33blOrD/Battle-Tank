# Battle-Tank
Studying from the Unreal Course of Udemy. Will try to be a little different than the original at the very least.

Concept: First will try to go with the tutorial, an open world head to head tank battle. After the section is done, I will try to add some new 
features, like making it endless and concepts of high scores or so.

Rules: Firstly, like the tutorial, player and opponent will start with Finite ammo and health. I will try to add some new things for endless
mode, like ammo will increase by a margin after defeating an enemy. For score, each enemy defeated will count as 1, if I can implement it.


My Progress:
* Cloned from GitHub to SourceTree
* Added Game Design Document to Readme
